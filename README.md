# Snowflake Well-Architected Framework (WAF) – Cortex Code Skills Demo

## Overview

This repository demonstrates how the **Snowflake Well-Architected Framework (WAF)** can be delivered as an **executable, AI-assisted engagement** using **Cortex Code skills**.

Instead of static documents or Excel questionnaires, WAF Skills provide a **guided, consistent, and repeatable way** to assess Snowflake environments across the five WAF pillars and produce actionable recommendations.

The demo shows how WAF becomes:
- Consultative (human-led, structured conversations)
- Consistent (same outcomes regardless of who runs it)
- Scalable (integrated with automation and tooling)
- Extensible (designed to evolve with the Snowflake platform)

## What This Demo Shows

- A **WAF Orchestrator skill** that:
  - Captures scope, goals, and constraints
  - Routes the engagement to relevant WAF pillar skills
  - Consolidates findings into a single report

- **Pillar-specific skills**, each focused on one WAF domain:
  - Security & Governance
  - Reliability
  - Performance Optimization
  - Cost Optimization & FinOps
  - Operational Excellence

- A structured output that can be:
  - Shared with customers
  - Used internally for scoping and planning
  - Mapped to Proactive Health Check (PHC) and Blueprints
